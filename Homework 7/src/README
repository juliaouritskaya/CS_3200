1. Open a text editor and create a new file.
2. Copy and paste your Java code into the file.
3. Save the file with a .java extension, for example, MyApplication.java.
4. Open a command prompt or terminal.
5. Navigate to the directory where you saved the Java file using the cd command. For example, if the file is saved on your desktop, use cd Desktop.
6. Compile the Java file by running the following command: javac MyApplication.java
   This command will generate a compiled .class file.
7. Run the Java application using the following command: java MyApplication
   Replace MyApplication with the actual name of your Java file (without the .java extension).
8. The Java application will now run, and any output will be displayed in the command prompt or terminal.
9. The application will prompt you to enter the MySQL username. Type in the username "root".
10. The application will prompt you to enter the MySQL password. Type in the password "Julia2003!".
11. The application will then execute and perform the necessary database operations.
12. Once the application finishes running, it will close the connection to the database and terminate.
